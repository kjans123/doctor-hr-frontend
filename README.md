Web based app that receives user email and queries online database through a flask server. The user types their email into the text field and clicks on Get Patient Data. Returns a table of two columns: the second column is a stored heartrate (in BPM) for the user and the first column is the time at which that heartrate was taken. Will auto-populate the text field with all the users in the database.
